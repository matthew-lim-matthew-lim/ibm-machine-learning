# Metrics we could use 

## Determining if a project has failed.

### Project Status Name

Check if the project status is 'Complete' or 'In-Progress'. A project that is not marked as 'Complete' could be considered a failure or delayed.

Hard to say, since a possible value for project status is `PNS`, which is unclear
as to whether it was failed, or is to be started at a later date.

### Project Phase Name and Project Phase Actual Start Date

Delays in starting phases or prolonged phases can indicate potential issues (or failure).

## Determining factors that could cause a project to fail

### Project Phase Actual End Date vs Project Phase Planned End Date

Calculate the difference between the actual end date and the planned end date. Projects that significantly exceed their planned end date might be considered failures.

### Project Budget Amount and Total Phase Actual Spending Amount

Consider the budgeted amount versus actual spending as a metric. Projects that significantly exceed their budget could be more inclined to fail.

### Project Description and Project Type

Certain types of projects or descriptions might have higher failure rates. Analyzing patterns in these attributes can help identify risk factors.
