The presentation is more business-oriented and presents the solution to a non-technical audience, though we did provide technical background and expand on concepts as necessary. 

### Our Product

#### A model to predict the success/failure of a proposed construction project.

- 98% recall of failing projects prior to starting: Identify projects which will fail if construction begins with current conditions.
- 93% recall of failing projects during progress: Identify projects which will fail if construction continues with current conditions.

#### A LLM with RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) to quickly retrieve construction codes and regulatory information.
